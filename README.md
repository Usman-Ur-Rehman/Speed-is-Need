# Speed-is-Need
Speed-is-Need is a car racing game developed in x86 assembly for DOS as part of an academic project. It was built to gain hands-on experience with machine-level programming and direct hardware interaction. The game operates in text-mode video memory, with all logic and rendering implemented without using any high-level libraries.
